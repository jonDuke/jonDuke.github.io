title: About me
---

My name is Jonathan Duke.  I'm currently studying data science full time, and this site will be a portfolio of my projects as I learn.

As you may notice, there's not a lot here yet.  I'm just starting, so I haven't had a chance to make many posts yet, but feel free to read what's here now and keep coming back if you want to see more in the future.

As for me, I grew up in Denver but now live in the Seattle area.  I have since fallen in love with the nature here and I'm happy to make this city my home.

When I'm not studying, my main hobbies right now are video games, hiking, and exploring music.
