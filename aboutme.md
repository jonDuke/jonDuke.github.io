My name is Jonathan Duke.  I'm currently studying data science full time, and this site will be a portfolio of my projects as I learn.

If you're here now, you may notice it's pretty empty.  Congrats on finding me before I was ready!  The site is new, so come back later for the good stuff.

As for me, I grew up in Denver but now live in the Seattle area.

When I'm not studying, my main hobbies right now are video games and hiking.  I'll make a post about them sometime as well.
