## Hello!

Welcome to my personal blog/portfolio website!  I am Jonathan Duke, and since I'm currently studying data science I figured I could use a place to show off what I can do.  I have a large interest in the machine learning and AI, so over time you'll see things tilt towards that side of data science.

I grew up in Denver, but eventually I moved to the Seattle area.  I've been here for 5 years now, and it's really starting to feel like home.

Aside from data science, I also have a large interest in video games.  Not just playing them, though I do too much of that, but I have played around with hobbyist game development for years, mostly in Unity.  I never got very serious with that so I don't have much public work to show, but it's still fun.  And you just *might* see a data science project or two involving games as well.

I've had many other hobbies over the years.  Hiking is my other current one, the picture at the top of this post is from one of my favorite hikes.  I'd say music is the other big one, though I haven't touched that in a while.  If I can find project ideas that involve these, you'll find them on this site as well.

Anyway, if you ever have questions or comments feel free to email me.  Thanks for checking out my work!
